    A blog (a truncation of the expression weblog)
    is a discussion or informational site published
    on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete entries
    ("posts") typically displayed in reverse chronological order
    (the most recent post appears first).
    Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,
    occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject.
    More recently, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) have developed,
    with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited.
    MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks,
    advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing
    quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging"
    systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into societal newstreams.
    Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.

    The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the
    advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content
    by non-technical users. (Previously, a knowledge of such technologies
    as HTML and FTP had been required to publish content on the Web.)
